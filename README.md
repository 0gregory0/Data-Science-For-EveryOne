### **Data Science For EveryOne Mentorship and BootCamp Program** 

**Data Science For Everyone** Program is [LuxDevHQ](https://twitter.com/LuxDevHQ) program that aims to make the field of data science accessible and understandable to a wide range of people, regardless of their background or expertise.

In the program we recognizes that data science has the potential to bring valuable insights and solutions to various domains and industries, and therefore, it is important to demystify and democratize this field. 

Data science involves extracting knowledge and insights from large and complex datasets using various techniques, such as data mining, statistical analysis, machine learning, and visualization. Traditionally, data science has been associated with specialized skills and technical expertise, requiring a strong background in mathematics, statistics, programming, and domain knowledge.

This Free Bootcamp emphasizes the need for clear communication, intuitive visualizations, and user-friendly tools that enable individuals to explore and analyze data without requiring an in-depth understanding of complex algorithms or programming languages. 

Overall,  we are aiming to bridge the gap between technical experts and non-technical professionals, enabling a broader audience to leverage the power of data and make informed decisions based on evidence and insights derived from data analysis.

Week 1 Projects: 

**Question 1).**  Imagine you're working with Sprint, one of the biggest telecom companies in the USA. They're really keen on figuring out how many customers might decide to leave them in the coming months. Luckily, they've got a bunch of past data about when customers have left before, as well as info about who these customers are, what they've bought, and other things like that.

So, if you were in charge of predicting customer churn how would you go about using machine learning to make a good guess about which customers might leave? Like, what steps would you take to create a machine learning model that can predict if someone's going to leave or not?

**Question 2).** Let’s say you’re a Product Data Scientist at Instagram. How would you measure the success of the Instagram TV product?

As a lead data engineer at Data Science East Africa, you are responsible for building a data engineering pipeline to move weather data from a public API to Azure Synapse Analytics. You will then use Power BI to access the data from Azure Synapse Analytics and create a modern dashboard. 

  (i). What are the best practices for moving data from a public API to a data lake?
  (ii). How can we ensure the security and reliability of the data pipeline?
  (iii). Implement this project, optimize your proccess, and create a GitHub repository where you will document all the proccesses including Screenshort, and a short video explaining the whole proccess. 


2). Project 2.

In week 3, we performed time series modeling on the Craigslist vehicles dataset, which is available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mbaabuharun/craigslist-vehicles. This project builds on that work. You will need to download the dataset, copy the data using SQL to a local PostgreSQL database, move the data from your local database to Snowflake, perform data transformation with DBT (data build tool), and use your preferred data visualization tool to create a report and dashboard.
