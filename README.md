## **Data Science For EveryOne Mentorship and BootCamp Program** 

**Data Science For Everyone** Program is [LuxDevHQ](https://twitter.com/LuxDevHQ) program that aims to make the field of data science accessible and understandable to a wide range of people, regardless of their background or expertise.

In the program we recognizes that data science has the potential to bring valuable insights and solutions to various domains and industries, and therefore, it is important to demystify and democratize this field. 

Data science involves extracting knowledge and insights from large and complex datasets using various techniques, such as data mining, statistical analysis, machine learning, and visualization. Traditionally, data science has been associated with specialized skills and technical expertise, requiring a strong background in mathematics, statistics, programming, and domain knowledge.

This Free Bootcamp emphasizes the need for clear communication, intuitive visualizations, and user-friendly tools that enable individuals to explore and analyze data without requiring an in-depth understanding of complex algorithms or programming languages. 

Overall,  we are aiming to bridge the gap between technical experts and non-technical professionals, enabling a broader audience to leverage the power of data and make informed decisions based on evidence and insights derived from data analysis.
